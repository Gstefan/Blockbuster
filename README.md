# Blockbuster:
Blockbuster is a clustering algorithm that partitions a set of time series into groups, such that correlation is higher within groups than between them. The algorithm uses the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix of the series to find the groups.

# Instructions:
1. Run the script blockbuster_visual_example.R for a visual example of what the algorithm does. 
2. Run the script blockbuster_data_example.R which applies the Blockbuster algorithm to the the simulated dataset found in sim_data_example.csv.
