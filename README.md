# Blockbuster:
Blockbuster is a clustering algorithm that partitions a set of series into groups using the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix.

# Instructions:
Begin by running the file blockbuster_visual_example.R for a visual example of what the algorithm does. Then run the file blockbuster_data_example.R which applies the Blockbuster algorithm to the the simulated dataset found in sim_data_example.csv.
